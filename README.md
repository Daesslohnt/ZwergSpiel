# ZwergSpiel

Instruction to launch the game:

At first you need to check that on your system python installed is.
You can prove it by opening of command prompt and tipping python of python3.
If python on your system installed is, it will show you the version
and python-command-prompt. In this case write exit() and press Enter.

In case you python dont have, go to your browser and download 3.6 version
Of course it should work on other later versions but so will be safer. 
Do not forget to install pip by installing of Python interpreter.

Ok, you have python interpreter
than open your command prompt again and with command go to the directory 
where you the project saved had.

in Windows
cd <name of directory> "go to the directory you wrote"
dir "it shows you all files and directories in your current directory"

The current directory must be ZwergSpiel
then write: pip install requirements.txt
it will install all needed frameworks for project

The late step:
write: python /game_board/interface_v2.py
